# netapp_ontap_api

NetApp OnTAP API is a wrapper around the provided NetApp API libraries.
This library is based off the diamond-ontapclustercollector found here:
https://github.com/SpringerPE/diamond-ontapclustercollector/

The intention of this API library wrapper is so that multiple different
metric collection programs can easily use this library to collect
metrics from NetApp devices regardless whether it is a 7-Mode or C-Mode
server.
